    CP Cost: '50'
    Credit Cost: Expensive
    Description: Aquanauts are environmentally adapted for underwater activities.
        They have seen a revival on exoplanets with habitable seas and oceans. Their
        heart rate slows while underwater, their skin includes a layer of blubber
        that retains heat, they store oxygen in their muscle tissue, and they do not
        suffer negative health effects from pressure changes. Additionally, their
        eyes have nictitating membranes and their corneas adjust to counter underwater
        refraction. Their hands and feet are webbed and they possess a transgenic
        swim bladder for controlling buoyancy. They can safely descend to about 200
        meters depth (roughly 6 atmospheres of pressure) without suffering narcotic
        effects or other diving problems.

    Description: This morph is specifically designed to be large, strong, and physically
        intimidating. Adopted early on by some sports performers, it quickly became
        a favorite among criminal cartels and thugs. At 2.5 meters tall, the morph
        may have difficulty moving comfortably in all but the most open and uncrowded
        of habitats. This morph’s “claws” extend from its knuckles and are more like
        reinforced bone brass knuckles.

    Credit Cost: Expensive (minimum 60,000+)
    Description: Like the surya and hulder morphs, the cloud skate is another biomorph
        that pushes the edge of what is possible. It is designed to be able to live
        in the atmospheres of gas giants, including Jupiter. This morph is shaped
        roughly like a tailless stingray with a pair of slender arms. The version
        of the swim bladder used by this morph provides neutral buoyancy in dense
        atmospheres, preventing it from sinking below a safe depth. Several small
        outer system collectives are planning to use these morphs to colonize the
        atmospheres of Saturn and Neptune and are also working on creating versions
        of animals and plants that can also live in these exotic environments.Implants:Basic

    Description: An enhanced version of ruster morphs, crashers are rugged and durable
        designs capable of weathering a range of harsh environments. They are the
        ideal biomorph for gatecrashing assignments and are popular among first-in
        teams. Though pricey compared to other biomorph options, many gatecrashers
        traveling to less habitable and dangerous environments have found the investment
        worth it.

    Description: This morph is not a publicly known model. It was developed in secret
        by a small group of unaffiliated async genehackers. It is only available to
        individuals who discover a connection to this unnamed, underground async network
        and then download the template from one of several secret mesh sites. The
        faust is a modified menton morph. Even under the most thorough scans, it appears
        to be nothing more than a mildly personalized version of that morph.

        lovingly applies. Flats are increasingly rare—most died off with the rest
        of humanity during the Fall. Most new children are splicers—screened and genefixed
        at the least—except in habitats where flats are treated as second-class citizens
        and indentured labor.

    Description: Many leaders want to ensure loyalty or at least obedience from their
        citizens, especially recently sleeved infugees. The freeman biomorph offers
        rulers (some would say tyrants or dictators) a chance to offer citizens a
        new life without worrying about dissidence. Based on the splicer morph, the
        freeman is genetically modified to be more obedient, which results in lower
        Willpower. More insidiously, freeman morphs are genetically modified with
        a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with
        an optogenetics module implant, these neurons can be activated and deactivated
        remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego’s
        behavior. (The specific behavior affected is chosen with each optogenetics
        module implant.)The freeman comes with a specialized monitor AGI installed
        in a modified ghostrider module. The monitor, usually a modified fork of the
        tyrant’s muse, watches and reports all suspicious actions taken by the primary
        ego. The purpose of this implant is often concealed. Citizens who sleeve into
        a freeman morph are told the implant is a security measure that helps prevent
        infection from TITAN technology or some similar lie. The module is designed
        to resist tampering and will report to headquarters the instant it detects
        a hacker’s intrusion. The monitor muse can manipulate the ego’s behavior or
        even take control of the morph via its puppet sock, but avoids doing that
        unless absolutely necessary. Dictators do not want to reveal that their citizens
        have spies implanted in their skulls, watching them.Surprisingly, some people
        voluntarily sleeve into freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility
        and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent
        Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.

        self-reliance, and adaptability, futuras were intended to help transhumanity
        regain its foothold. These programs proved disastrous and the line was discontinued,

    Description: Originally created as part of a fad based on 20th-century images
        of aliens, the grey morph soon became popular with eccentric scientists and
        engineers. This morph’s slender and weak-looking body stands only 1.5 meters
        tall, short compared to modern transhumans. Its distinctive large head and
        eyes strike many transhumans as disturbing.

        survive exposure to the frigid atmosphere of Titan—but they can handle it
        slightly longer than other morphs. Hazers tend to be fair and slender, with
        chiseled features. Some have features so angular or elﬁn that their beauty
        is alien and unsettling to other human phenotypes. Striking Looks and Uncanny
        Valley are both common morph traits.

    Description: Hibernoids are transgenic-modified humans with heavily-altered sleep
        patterns and metabolic processes. Hibernoids have a decreased need for sleep,
        requiring only 1-2 hours a day on average. They also have the ability to trigger
        a form of voluntary hibernation, effectively stopping their metabolism and
        need for oxygen. Hibernoids make excellent long-duration space travelers and
        habtechs, but these morphs are also favored by personal aides and hypercapitalists
        with non-stop lifestyles.

    Description: Hulder are engineered for survival in the Titanian wilds. In silhouette,
        their bodies resemble a long-legged great auk, though viewed up close, the
        resemblance to a bird ends. Hulder have no feathers, but rather smooth, rubbery
        charcoal or black skin covering a thick layer of nano-augmented blubber. What
        resembles a thick bill from a distance is actually a seamless protrusion of
        the face, packed with sensory augmentations. Hulder stand 2 meters tall and
        weigh on average 135 kilograms. Their sensory organs, webbed feet, and ﬁngers
        are all cybernetic.Hulder can only tolerate temperatures hospitable to baseline
        transhumans for short periods of time. In the open, they must balance their
        bodies’ chemical reservoirs with other hulder and caribou once per month or
        with a chemical reserve pack. A typical band of 2–6 hulder and 10–20 caribou
        can go about a year before having to visit a hab or a station like Huvudskär
        to replenish chemical reserves.

    Credit Cost: Expensive (Minimum 40,000+)
    Description: This morph is an attempt by a research team on Bright to create a
        successor to the menton, making it the most intelligence-enhanced morph ever
        created. Work on the hyperbright morph has been plagued with difficulties,
        as the designers attempt to push technical limits, creating a morph that can
        work at peak efficiency without distraction for long periods of time. In an
        effort to create a morph that proves their design and earns some positive
        reputation for their project, the creators took short cuts that caused the
        morph to have several distinctive and potentially annoying quirks, including
        an inherent need for drugs to stabilize its exotic neurochemistry. The result
        is a morph that is instantly recognizable by the brightly colored bony crest
        along the skull that helps cool its brain. Despite its quirks, the hyperbright
        has gained a small following among a number of scientists and engineers, especially
        since it has been optimized for use in the low-g environments of the outer
        system. When created or used on Bright, this morph is usually also ﬁtted with
        the parallel processor nanoware.

    Description: This morph is a version of the exalt morph that has been adapted
        to fly in Earth normal air pressure as long as the gravity is 0.2 g or less.
        Though this morph is available on other low-g worlds and habitats, it was
        developed for and is primarily found on Luna. This morph resembles a typical
        exalt morph, except that it is lightly built, has larger lungs, and has feathered
        wings with a wingspan of 3 meters. The wings come out of the back torso and
        leave the morph’s hands and wrists unhindered. The wings may also be folded
        behind the body.

        levels. Now they are found predominantly in the city of Olympus, where environmental
        conditions will always be incredibly harsh. Avid rock climbers and outdoor
        types also favor this morph, and in recent years it has enjoyed an unusual
        vogue among chic urbanites going for a rough-and-ready look without sleeving
        in the more de classe ruster morph.

    Description: Mentons are genetically modified to increase cognitive abilities,
        particularly learning ability, creativity, attentiveness, and memory. Rumors
        exist of super-enhanced mentons with more extreme intelligence mods, but brain-hacking
        is notoriously difficult, and many attempts to redesign mental faculties result
        in impaired functioning, instability, or insanity.

    Description: Neo-avians include ravens, crows, and gray parrots uplifted to human-level
        intelligence. Their physical sizes are much larger than their non-uplifted
        cousins (to the size of a human child), with larger heads for their increased
        brain size. Numerous transgenic modifications have been made to their wings,
        allowing them to retain limited flight capabilities at 1 g, but giving them
        a more bat-like physiology so they can bend and fold better, and adding primitive
        digits for basic tool manipulation. Their toes are also more articulated and
        now accompanied with an opposable thumb. Neo-avians have adapted well to microgravity
        environments, and are favored for their small size and reduced resource use.

    Credit Cost: Expensive (minimum 35,000)
    Description: The uplifted versions of various dolphin species are very similar
        to baseline dolphins physiologically. Thanks to the oxygen reserve implant,
        neo-dolphins can stay underwater for longer (Cerean dolphins have gills installed,
        as the subcrustal sea has no breathable atmosphere above it). Common neo-dolphin
        germlines lack hands or other limbs, though cybernetic arms or even bioware
        enhancements are not uncommon.Neo-dolphin morphs are very rare, since there
        are few habitats that can support them, and they are almost never found apart
        from aquatic environments.

    Aptitude Maximum: 20 (SOM), 30 (all else)
    CP Cost: '25'
    Credit Cost: Expensive
    Description: Neotenics are transhumans modified to retain a child-like form. They
        are smaller, more agile, inquisitive, and less resource-depleting, making
        them ideal for habitat living and spacecraft. Some people find neotenic sleeves
        distasteful, especially when employed in certain media and sex work capacities.

    CP Cost: '30'
    Credit Cost: Expensive
    Description: While synthmorphs are the ﬁrst choice for many gatecrashers, morph
        designers have made great headway in creating biomorphs suitable for hazardous
        exoplanets. The nomad biomorph is optimized for operating in desert environments
        and takes many of its traits from the camel, prompting some observers to mistake
        the nomad for a pod morph. With an elongated face designed like a camel to
        trap water vapor in the nostrils as the morph exhales, nomads are clearly
        off-putting to many bioconservatives. Some models also have camel feet for
        better travels in sandy dune environments. Nomads are actually quite hefty
        under normal circumstances, as they are designed to be able to carry large
        amounts of fat tissue. Their fat tissue can be moved around their body to
        adapt to high or low temperatures. When nomads are in the ﬁeld, however, they
        can become quite skinny, as they survive for months on their fat tissue alone.
    Disadvantages: Uncanny Valley trait

    Description: 'These uplifted octopi sleeves have proven quite useful in zero-gravity
        environments. They retain eight arms, their chameleon ability to change skin
        color, ink sacs, and a sharp beak. They also have increased brain mass and
        longevity, can breathe both air and water, and lack a skeletal structure so
        they can squeeze through tight spaces. Octomorphs typically crawl along in
        zero-gravity using their arm suckers and expelling air for propulsion and
        can even walk on two of their arms in low gravity. Their eyes have been enhanced
        with color vision, provide a 360-degree field of vision, and they rotationally
        adjust to keep the slit-shaped pupil aligned with “up.” A transgenic vocal
        system allows them to speak.Advantages: 8 Arms, Beak Attack (1d10 DV, -1 AP,

    Aptitude Maximum: '30'
    CP Cost: '40'
    Credit Cost: Expensive
    Description: Salamanders are a type of biomorph popular with Solarians. They share
        some of the physiological traits of suryas, but are unable to survive unprotected
        in the corona (requiring a solar survival suit, like other biomorphs), and
        are instead bio-engineered to survive in the protected vacuum of coronal habitats.
        Their skin is thick, hairless, vaguely reptilian, and mostly black in color,
        with gold and orange body patterning. Like suryas, salamanders communicate
        either via wireless transmissions or by “sunspotting”—using their chromatophores
        to shift light and dark patterns on their skin to form patterns easily comprehensible
        to other coronal morphs. Salamanders have a wiry, streamlined, swept-back
        sort of look, a combination of fey and monkey-like. Their heads are also somewhat
        reptilian, with reflective eyes, no nose, and no mouth.Their feet are prehensile,
        usable just like hands. They lack reproductive organs and capabilities and
        feature cyberware gas jets on their chest and back for maneuvering in zero
        g. Many Solarians who normally inhabit suryas will sleeve into salamanders
        if they need to use humanoid tools or interact with non-Solarians.

        but their legs are fused into a pair of hind ﬂippers for powerful swimming.
        On land, they can stand but have difficulty moving, as they must ﬂop, roll,
        or hop like a seal. They are adapted for the lack of air, deep cold, and crushing
        pressure of subcrustal seas.Advantages: +5 COO, +10 SOM, +5 to one other aptitude

    CP Cost: '50'
    Credit Cost: Expensive (minimum 30,000+)
    Description: Named for a Hindu sun deity, suryas swim freely in the sun’s corona.
        Looking roughly like whales or orcas, suryas may reach lengths of ten meters
        or more. They generate powerful magnetic fields that shield them from solar
        radiation and heat, while allowing them to surf the solar wind and extract
        ionized particles. Strong bones and connective tissues protect against the
        crushing solar gravity. Beneath their thick hides are channels of liquid water
        interleaved with layers of fat which serve to shield the organism from harmful
        radiation. Engineered medichines repair tissue damaged by radiation and convert
        hydrogen ions into water.A surya’s skin is an extraordinary organ, embedded
        with chromatophores that allow them to transmit alternating patterns of light
        and dark for communication. In addition, a lateral line runs down their sides,
        allowing them to detect the long-period sound waves that reflect off the sun’s
        lower atmosphere and resonate through the corona’s gas and plasma. Suryas
        traveling through the transition zone between the corona and the chromosphere
        use these vibrations to predict and avoid heavy solar weather.

    Description: While there are no sanctioned explorations of Earth, a few daring
        or greedy transhumans defy the laws to salvage there. Some scavengers and
        explorers still scour the ruins of habitats that were destroyed during the
        Fall. Others look for wealth and secrets in the quarantined zones on Luna
        and Mars. Some simply seek out remaining TITAN machines to destroy, wherever
        they may be found. The theseus is a popular biomorph for this type of work.
        Its medichines and nanophages keep the morph protected from most attacks by
        exsurgent nanotech, and the lack of a cyberbrain makes it less vulnerable
        to mind hacking. An emergency farcaster allows the user to safely return from
        situations where both their morph and their cortical stack might be destroyed
        or corrupted.

        this morph also features gliding membranes that allow it to soar through the
        upper Venusian atmosphere. It can even gain altitude by riding thermals (which
        it can see using its enhanced vision). Once Venusian terraforming efforts
        are complete, an upgraded version of this morph will be able to breathe normally.
